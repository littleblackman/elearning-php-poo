How to move from a static to a dynamic page using the object


Each branchs show how to add POO, step by step

Here all branchs

  00-static-page-html             First version html static page
  01-add-book                     Add books manually is boring, but in html/css without a bdd, there is no choice
  02-create-a-static-page         A little bit of php with adding an array to show all books
  03-create-a-dynamic-page        Connect the site to a bdd and add the update page to create an entry in bdd
  04-organize-the-code            Clean the code and organize it with variables and includes
  05-organize-files-and-folders   Organize alls folders and files correctly (and how find them easily)
  06-entity-as-super-var          POO is starting: add the first entity
  07-add-a-manager                Add the manager class to connect a object to the bdd
  08-create-crud-autoload         Create CRUD AND an autoload
  09-a-bddManager-to-add-class    Add a bddManager and extend it from other managers
  10-add-abstract-interface-trait Customize class with abstract, interfaces and traits
  
  Next step ? .... MVC of course :-)
